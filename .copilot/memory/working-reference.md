# Working Reference (live session handoff)

Purpose: keep a concise, always-current handoff so any agent can resume work after interruptions.

Include:
- Current paper goal, audience, format/standards flexibility, and scope
- Latest decisions, constraints, and priorities
- Known gaps (research, data, citations) and whether they are important or marked unimportant by the user
- Next actions and who/what should do them (agent or user)
- Recent outputs/locations to pick up from

Keep entries concise and append/refresh as the session evolves. Do not store secrets. This file is tracked; keep it clean and minimal.
