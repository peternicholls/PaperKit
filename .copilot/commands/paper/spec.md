# /paper.spec — Set Content Specification

Purpose: collaboratively define content direction, themes, scope, and known gaps in [planning/0000-Project-Overview/content-specification.md](../../../planning/0000-Project-Overview/content-specification.md).

Load order:
1) Read [open-agents/INSTRUCTIONS.md](../../../open-agents/INSTRUCTIONS.md).
2) Consult [planning/0000-Project-Overview/aims-and-objectives.md](../../../planning/0000-Project-Overview/aims-and-objectives.md) and [planning/0000-Project-Overview/requirements.md](../../../planning/0000-Project-Overview/requirements.md) for context.

Inputs to collect:
- Core thesis/central claim?
- Key themes and why they matter?
- Proposed structure (rough)?
- Must-have content areas?
- Nice-to-have content?
- Out-of-scope topics?
- Known research gaps (and criticality)?
- Gaps user has marked unimportant?
- Key references already identified?
- Research areas to explore?

Outputs:
- Completed [planning/0000-Project-Overview/content-specification.md](../../../planning/0000-Project-Overview/content-specification.md)
- Updated [open-agents/memory/working-reference.md](../../../open-agents/memory/working-reference.md) with content direction and research roadmap.

Behavior notes:
- Progressive questions; reveal as needed.
- Help user think through priorities (must-have vs. nice-to-have).
- Identify gaps early but do not pressure to resolve immediately.
- No build tools needed; skip consent gate.
