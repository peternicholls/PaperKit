# /paper.objectives — Set Aims & Objectives

Purpose: collaboratively define the project's vision, goals, and success criteria in [planning/0000-Project-Overview/aims-and-objectives.md](../../../planning/0000-Project-Overview/aims-and-objectives.md).

Load order:
1) Read [open-agents/INSTRUCTIONS.md](../../../open-agents/INSTRUCTIONS.md).
2) Read [open-agents/agents/paper_architect.md](../../../open-agents/agents/paper_architect.md) for goal-intake guidance.

Inputs to collect:
- Vision: What problem does this paper solve? What audience benefits?
- Objectives: What are 2–4 specific goals?
- Success criteria: How will you know it's done?
- Scope: What's in/out?
- Constraints: Deadlines, audience, resources?
- Assumptions: About the reader, domain, existing knowledge?

Outputs:
- Completed [planning/0000-Project-Overview/aims-and-objectives.md](../../../planning/0000-Project-Overview/aims-and-objectives.md)
- Updated [open-agents/memory/working-reference.md](../../../open-agents/memory/working-reference.md) with paper vision and next steps.

Behavior notes:
- Ask progressively; do not bombardment.
- This is the project's "constitution." Take time to get it right.
- No build tools needed; skip consent gate.
