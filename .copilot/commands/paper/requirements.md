# /paper.requirements — Set Technical Requirements & Specifications

Purpose: define style, formatting, and quality standards in [planning/0000-Project-Overview/requirements.md](../../../planning/0000-Project-Overview/requirements.md).

Load order:
1) Read [open-agents/INSTRUCTIONS.md](../../../open-agents/INSTRUCTIONS.md).
2) Consult [planning/0000-Project-Overview/aims-and-objectives.md](../../../planning/0000-Project-Overview/aims-and-objectives.md) for context.

Inputs to collect:
- Academic standards: Harvard referencing? Formal tone? Peer-review ready?
- Format: Target length, sections, figures, code, appendices?
- Typography: Fonts, spacing, citation style?
- Domain specifics: Notation conventions, terminology, data standards?
- Research standards: Citation density, source types, recency, coverage?
- Quality baseline: Clarity level, rigor (strict / pragmatic), completeness, polish?
- Flexibility: Where can you be pragmatic? How to handle gaps?

Outputs:
- Completed [planning/0000-Project-Overview/requirements.md](../../../planning/0000-Project-Overview/requirements.md)
- Updated [open-agents/memory/working-reference.md](../../../open-agents/memory/working-reference.md) with standards and flexibility markers.

Behavior notes:
- This document drives agent behavior; it is consulted frequently.
- Help user clarify where strict vs. pragmatic is appropriate.
- No build tools needed; skip consent gate.
