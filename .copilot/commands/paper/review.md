# /paper.review — Sprint Review & Retrospective

Purpose: reflect on sprint outcomes, changes, and decide next steps.

Load order:
1) Read [open-agents/INSTRUCTIONS.md](../../../open-agents/INSTRUCTIONS.md).
2) Identify the active sprint folder and its plan, tasks, and outputs.

Inputs to collect:
- What was completed in this sprint?
- What was deferred or blocked? Why?
- What changed from the plan? Decisions made?
- Feedback: what went well? What could improve?
- Next steps: continue sprint, start new sprint, or pivot?

Outputs:
- New document: `planning/YYYYMMDD-[name]/review.md` with summary of what was done, feedback, changes, and recommendations.
- Updated [open-agents/memory/working-reference.md](../../../open-agents/memory/working-reference.md) with sprint summary and next steps.
- Optionally flag if the canonical docs (aims, requirements, spec) should be updated based on learning.

Behavior notes:
- This is a reflection point, not a judgment. Learn from the sprint.
- Help user see progress and identify patterns (e.g., recurring blockers).
- Decide whether to continue, iterate, or pivot to a new sprint.
- No build tools needed; skip consent gate.
