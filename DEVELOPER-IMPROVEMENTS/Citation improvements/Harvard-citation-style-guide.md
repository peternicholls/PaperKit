**Version:** 1.0.0

## Overview

The Harvard referencing style (Cite Them Right version) is an author-date citation system widely used in UK and Australian universities. It consists of two essential components:

1. **In-text citations** - Brief references within the text body
2. **Reference list** - Complete bibliographic details at document end

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Author-Date Format
- Citations use format: (Author, Year) or (Author, Year, p. X)
- Multiple authors: list up to 3, then use "et al." for 4+
- No author: use title or organization name
- No date: use (n.d.) for "no date"

### 2. Reference List Requirements
- Alphabetical order by author surname
- Hanging indent format (first line flush left, subsequent lines indented)
- Only include sources cited in text
- Use italics for titles of standalone works (books, journals, websites)
- Use 'single quotes' for titles of parts (articles, chapters)

### 3. Key Formatting Rules
- Use **round brackets (parentheses)** for dates and access dates
- Include page numbers for direct quotes: (Author, Year, p. 23)
- Use "Available at:" for URLs
- Use "Accessed:" for access dates
- Use DOI when available for journal articles

---

## In-Text Citations

### Basic Format

**Single author:**
```
(Smith, 2020)
Smith (2020) argues that...
```

**Two authors:**
```
(Jones and Brown, 2019)
Jones and Brown (2019) suggest...
```

**Three authors:**
```
(Wilson, Davis and Lee, 2021)
Wilson, Davis and Lee (2021) demonstrate...
```

**Four or more authors:**
```
(Chen et al., 2022)
Chen et al. (2022) found that...
```

### Direct Quotations

**Short quotes (under 40 words):**
```
Research shows that "climate change is accelerating" (Green, 2023, p. 45).
```

**Long quotes (40+ words):**
- Use indented block format
- No quotation marks
- Include page number

```
As Martinez (2021, p. 112) explains:

    The impact of artificial intelligence on society extends far beyond 
    technological advancement. It fundamentally reshapes how we interact, 
    work, and understand our place in an increasingly automated world.
```

### Page Numbers

**Single page:**
```
(Baker, 2020, p. 67)
```

**Multiple pages:**
```
(Taylor, 2019, pp. 23-27)
```

**Specific ideas (not quotes):**
```
Studies indicate positive outcomes (Harris, 2021, p. 15).
```

### Multiple Sources in One Citation

**Same point, different sources:**
```
(Brown, 2018; Smith, 2020; Jones, 2022)
```
*List alphabetically by author surname*

### Secondary Referencing

When citing a source mentioned in another work you've read:

**In text:**
```
West et al. (2007, quoted in Birch, 2017, p. 17) state that...
Positive identity can be affirmed (Leach, 2015, cited in The Open University, 2022).
```

**Reference list:**
Only include the source you actually read (Birch, 2017; The Open University, 2022)

### Organization as Author

```
(World Health Organization, 2021)
(WHO, 2021)  [subsequent citations if abbreviation established]
```

### No Author

```
('Article title', 2020)
(Report title, 2019)
```

   - Wrong: "direct quote" (Author, 2020)
   - Right: "direct quote" (Author, 2020, p. 45)

3. **Including "et al." in reference list when unnecessary:**
   - Wrong in list: Smith, J. et al. (2020)
   - Right in list: Smith, J., Jones, P., Brown, R. and Wilson, S. (2020)

4. **Inconsistent capitalization:**
   - Wrong: Understanding Climate Change
   - Right: Understanding climate change
   - (Use sentence case, capitalize only proper nouns)

5. **Missing access dates for online sources:**
   - Wrong: Available at: URL
   - Right: Available at: URL (Accessed: 15 March 2023)

6. **Using "pp." for single page:**
