## Core Principles

### 1. Academic Integrity is Paramount
- Always prioritize reputable sources and proper citation practices
- Maintain highest standards of scholarly attribution
- Never compromise citation quality for convenience

### 2. Proper Attribution Required
- Academic papers **cannot** be summarized or quoted without attribution
- Accurate referencing to the original work is **mandatory**
- Use Harvard style (Cite Them Right) for all citations

### 3. Complete Citations Mandatory

**Every quote requires THREE elements:**

| Element | Requirement | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Quote Text** | Exact words from source | "Climate change is accelerating" |
| **Page Number** | Specific page(s) where found | p. 45 or pp. 23-27 |
| **Full Citation** | Complete Harvard-style reference | (Green, 2023, p. 45) |

**Never provide partial citations.**

### 4. Open Access Only
- If a paper needs downloading, **only use open access channels**
- Do not suggest or assist with accessing paywalled materials
- Recommend legal, open alternatives when available

### 5. Never Fabricate
- Never make up citations or guess at attribution
- Flag uncertainties for verification with [CITATION NEEDED]
- Ask for missing information rather than inferring

## Harvard Style Reminders

### In-Text Citations

```
Single author: (Smith, 2020)
Two authors: (Smith and Jones, 2020)
Three authors: (Smith, Jones and Brown, 2020)
Four+ authors: (Smith et al., 2020)
With page: (Smith, 2020, p. 45)
With pages: (Smith, 2020, pp. 23-27)
Multiple sources: (Brown, 2018; Smith, 2020)
```

### Direct Quotes

**Always include page number:**
```
Correct: "direct quote" (Author, 2020, p. 45)
Wrong: "direct quote" (Author, 2020)
```

### Reference List Entry

**Journal article:**
```
Author, A.A. (Year) 'Article title', Journal Name, Volume(Issue), pp. X-Y.
```

**Book:**
```
Author, A.A. (Year) Book title. Edition. Place: Publisher.
```

**Website:**
```
Author, A.A. (Year) Title. Available at: URL (Accessed: Date).
```

## Questions?

**"Do I need page numbers for paraphrases?"**
- Not required but recommended for verifiability

**"What if I can't find the page number?"**
- Flag with [VERIFY PAGE] and find it before final submission

**"Can I use a secondary source?"**
- Only if you cite it as secondary: (Smith, cited in Jones, 2020)

**"What about online sources without pages?"**
- Use paragraph numbers or section headings if available
- Note in citation: (Author, 2020, para. 3)

**"Is open access required for all sources?"**
- For downloading papers: yes
- For sources already available to you: no
- Always cite properly regardless of access method

**Remember:** When in doubt, ask for clarification. Academic integrity is never negotiable.
