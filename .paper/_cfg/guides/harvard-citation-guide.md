**Owner:** Core Team

## Overview

The Harvard referencing style (Cite Them Right version) is an author-date citation system widely used in UK and Australian universities. It consists of two essential components:

1. **In-text citations** - Brief references within the text body
2. **Reference list** - Complete bibliographic details at document end

---

## Academic Integrity Statement

**CRITICAL:** Academic integrity is paramount in all citation and referencing practices:

- **Always prioritize reputable sources and proper citation practices**
- **An academic paper cannot be summarized or quoted without proper attribution and accurate referencing to the original work in Harvard style**
- **Every quote requires three elements:**
  1. The quote text itself
  2. The page number(s)
  3. The full citation for both in-text use and the bibliography
- **If a paper needs downloading, only use open access channels**
- **Never fabricate or guess at citations - flag uncertainties for verification**
- **All sources must be properly cited for both the text and the bibliography**

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Author-Date Format
- Citations use format: (Author, Year) or (Author, Year, p. X)
- Multiple authors: list up to 3, then use "et al." for 4+
- No author: use title or organization name
- No date: use (n.d.) for "no date"

### 2. Reference List Requirements
- Alphabetical order by author surname
- Hanging indent format (first line flush left, subsequent lines indented)
- Only include sources cited in text
- Use italics for titles of standalone works (books, journals, websites)
- Use 'single quotes' for titles of parts (articles, chapters)

### 3. Key Formatting Rules
- Use **round brackets (parentheses)** for dates and access dates
- Include page numbers for direct quotes: (Author, Year, p. 23)
- Use "Available at:" for URLs
- Use "Accessed:" for access dates
- Use DOI when available for journal articles

```

**Long quotes (40+ words):**
- Use indented block format
- No quotation marks

As Martinez (2021, p. 112) explains:

    The impact of artificial intelligence on society extends far beyond 
    technological advancement. It fundamentally reshapes how we interact,
