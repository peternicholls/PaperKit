# Planning Overview

This folder holds collaborative planning and sprint work for your paper.

## Structure

### `0000-Project-Overview/`
Canonical documents built with you at the start:
- **aims-and-objectives.md** — The "constitution" of your paper (goals, objectives, success criteria)
- **requirements.md** — Technical & style specifications (academic standards, formatting, quality expectations)
- **content-specification.md** — Content direction, themes, scope, gaps, and known sources

These documents are the source of truth. Agents consult them before making decisions.

### `YYYYMMDD-[Session-Name]/`
Dated sprint folders for focused work sessions. Example: `20251213-Introduction-Draft` or `20251215-Gap-Research`

Each sprint folder typically contains:
- **plan.md** — Outline and methodology for this sprint
- **tasks.md** — Tracked user requests and agent progress
- **review.md** — Notes on what was completed, feedback, changes made
- Other dated documents as needed (research notes, draft versions, decisions)

## Workflow

1. **Initialize** — Agents help you create the three canonical docs in `0000-Project-Overview/`.
2. **Plan a sprint** — Create a dated folder (`YYYYMMDD-[name]`) with a plan and task list.
3. **Execute** — Work through tasks; agents update as they complete work.
4. **Review** — Reflect on what was done, what changed, what's next.
5. **Loop** — Start a new sprint or iterate within the current one.

## How Agents Use This

- **Paper Architect** and other agents read the canonical docs before planning or drafting.
- **Session agents** (Plan, Tasks, Review) manage the sprint folders and keep the working reference synced.
- **Specialist agents** (Brainstormer, Solver, Tutor, Librarian) consult these docs and add their findings to sprint folders.

## Key Principle

These documents are **collaborative**. You shape them; agents refine them. They evolve as your thinking clarifies.
