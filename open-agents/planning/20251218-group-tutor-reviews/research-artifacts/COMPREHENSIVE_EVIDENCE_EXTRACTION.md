## SECTION 02: Perceptual Foundations

### 2.1 The Riemannian Nature of Color Space

#### Hong et al. (2024) — Geodesic Framework

**Full Citation:**  
Hong, F., Bouhassira, R., Chow, J., Sanders, C., Shvartsman, M., Guan, P., Williams, A.H. and Brainard, D.H. (2024) 'Comprehensive characterization of human color discrimination thresholds', *eLife*, 13:RP108943. doi:10.7554/eLife.108943.

**Key Quotes:**

> "An alternative framework, originally proposed by Fechner (Fechner, 1860) and explored subsequently (Schrödinger, 1920; Macadam, 1979; Wyszecki, 1982; Zaidi, 2001; Koenderink, 2010; Bujack et al., 2022; Roberti, 2024; Stark et al., 2025), suggests that supra-threshold differences may be understood as the accumulation of small threshold-level differences along a path between stimuli. In this framework, **color space is taken to be a Riemannian manifold—a space that is locally Euclidean but may be globally curved**."  
> — Hong et al. (2024), Discussion

> "The perceptual distance between two colors is hypothesized to correspond to the **geodesic**—the shortest path between them in terms of accumulated thresholds. This distance is computed by integrating local thresholds along all possible paths between the two points and selecting the path with the smallest total."  
> — Hong et al. (2024), Discussion

> "Major axes of elliptical threshold contours consistently **radially oriented toward achromatic center**"  
> — Hong et al. (2024), Abstract

**Relevance to Paper:**
- **Section 02:** Validates that color space is NOT Euclidean—geodesics are curved, not straight lines.
- **Section 03:** Justifies that "linear interpolation" in any color space is perceptually incorrect.
- **Section 04:** The radial orientation of discrimination ellipses toward achromatic center suggests saturation modulation is "safer" than hue rotation.

#### Roberti & Peruzzi (2023) — Schrödinger's Line Element

**Full Citation:**  
Roberti, V. and Peruzzi, G. (2023) 'The Helmholtz legacy in color metrics: Schrödinger's color theory', *Archive for History of Exact Sciences*. doi:10.1007/s00407-023-00317-x.

**Key Quotes:**

> "Helmholtz's Riemannian line element for three-dimensional color space **laid the foundation for all subsequent studies in the field of color metrics**, although it was largely forgotten for almost three decades from the time of its first publication."  
> — Roberti & Peruzzi (2023), Abstract

> "According to Schrödinger's definition, the pioneering color-matching experiments carried out by James Clerk Maxwell in the 1850s fell in the domain of the **lower color metric**, while Helmholtz's work on the line element implied the definition of **just noticeable color differences** (i.e., the smallest perceptual differences) between two color stimuli and, therefore, belonged to the domain of the **higher color metric**."  
> — Roberti & Peruzzi (2023), Section 3

**Relevance to Paper:**
- **Section 02:** Historical foundation for the Riemannian approach to color space.
- **Footnote Material:** Distinction between "lower" (matching) and "higher" (discrimination) color metrics.

### 2.2 The 720° Topology Proof

#### Nölle, Suda & Boxleitner (2012) — H2SI Space

**Full Citation:**  
Nölle, M., Suda, M. and Boxleitner, W. (2012) 'H2SI – A new perceptual colour space', *ResearchGate* preprint.

**Key Quotes:**

> "'**Super-importance of hue**', as pointed out by Judd, requires a space for colour representations that enables unit circles to have a circumference of roughly **720°**, i.e. twice the circumference of a unit circle in Euclidean space."  
> — Nölle et al. (2012), p. 3

> "The circumference of a fully saturated colour circle (S = 1) is given by:
> $$U(S=1) = \int_0^{2\pi} \sqrt{g_{HH}} \, dH \approx 12.65$$
> This value is approximately $4\pi$."  
> — Nölle et al. (2012), Eq. 3.11

> "His results [MacAdam's ellipses] were strengthened by Judd who concluded that **no ideal colour space, especially no three-dimensional Euclidean space** supports geometrical properties where MacAdam ellipses, i.e. perceived unit differences of colour, can lie on unit circles."  
> — Nölle et al. (2012), p. 2

**Relevance to Paper:**
- **Section 02:** Mathematical proof that 3D Euclidean color spaces CANNOT be perceptually uniform.
- **Section 07:** Validates the Möbius loop—720° required for topological closure.
- **Appendix B:** Could include the integral derivation as extended mathematical treatment.

### 2.3 Color Appearance Phenomena

#### Fairchild (2013) — Hunt Effect & Stevens Effect

**Full Citation:**  
Fairchild, M.D. (2013) *Color Appearance Models*. 3rd edn. Chichester: John Wiley & Sons.

**Key Quotes:**

> "The **Hunt effect** and **Stevens effect** describe the apparent increase in colorfulness and contrast of scenes with increases in illumination level."  
> — Fairchild (2013), Introduction, p. xxii

> "Like beauty, color is in the eye of the beholder. For as long as human scientific inquiry has been recorded, the nature of color perception has been a topic of great interest. Despite tremendous evolution of technology, **fundamental issues of color perception remain unanswered**."  
> — Fairchild (2013), p. xix

> "Various mechanisms of chromatic adaptation generally make us unaware of these gradual changes. However, **we are all looking at the world through a yellow filter** that not only changes with age, but is significantly different from observer to observer."  
> — Fairchild (2013), p. 3

**Relevance to Paper:**
- **Section 02:** Hunt and Stevens effects explain why brightness affects color appearance.
- **Section 05:** Individual variation in lens yellowing affects color perception—relevant to user calibration.
- **Section 11:** Observer variability is inherent—system must accommodate this.

## SECTION 03: Journey Construction

### 3.1 Natural Variance in Daylight

#### Walmsley et al. (2015) — Blue-Yellow Dominance

**Full Citation:**  
Walmsley, L., Hanna, L., Mouland, J., Martial, F., West, A., Smedley, A.R., Bechtold, D.A., Webb, A.R., Lucas, R.J. and Brown, T.M. (2015) 'Colour as a signal for entraining the mammalian circadian clock', *PLOS Biology*, 13(4), e1002127. doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.1002127.

**Key Quotes:**

> "**Colour was in fact more predictive of sun position across twilight (-7 to 0° below horizon) than was irradiance (78.5 ± 0.1% versus 75.8 ± 0.1% of variance explained by solar angle)**"  
> — Walmsley et al. (2015), Results

> "mammalian **blue–yellow colour discrimination provides a more reliable method of tracking twilight progression** than simply measuring irradiance"  
> — Walmsley et al. (2015), Abstract

> "we observed a **progressive enrichment of short-wavelength light across negative solar angles**: a result of the increasing amount of ozone absorption and consequent **Chappuis band filtering of green–yellow light** when the sun was below the horizon"  
> — Walmsley et al. (2015), Results

> "the use of colour as an indicator of time of day is an **evolutionarily conserved strategy, perhaps even representing the original purpose of colour vision**"  
> — Walmsley et al. (2015), Discussion

**Relevance to Paper:**
- **Section 03:** Validates that color (Blue-Yellow axis) is the PRIMARY signal for temporal tracking, not brightness.
- **Section 06:** "Natural" mode should prioritize chromatic accuracy over luminance accuracy.
- **Section 07:** Twilight provides biological template for gradual chromatic transitions.
- **Philosophy:** Evolutionary grounding for the entire Color Journey premise.

### 3.2 Circadian Photoentrainment

#### Spitschan (2017) — Melanopsin Contributions

**Full Citation:**  
Spitschan, M. (2017) 'Melanopsin contributions to non-visual and visual function', *Current Opinion in Behavioral Sciences*, 30, pp. 67-72. doi:10.1016/j.cobeha.2019.06.004.

**Key Quotes:**

> "Melanopsin absorbs light in the short-wavelength range of the visible spectrum, with λmax at or near **480 nm**"  
> — Spitschan (2017), Section 2

> "Circadian phase shifting is **biased towards short wavelength light**, with evidence for a spectral sensitivity broadly proportional to melanopsin activation"  
> — Spitschan (2017), Section on Circadian Phase Shifting

> "**melatonin suppression and circadian phase are separable and functionally decoupled systems**, with neither being a proxy for the other"  
> — Spitschan (2017), Section on Circadian Phase Shifting

**Relevance to Paper:**
- **Section 03:** Melanopsin sensitivity (480nm) explains why blue light is biologically special.
- **Section 06:** Circadian modes need to consider both melatonin suppression AND phase shifting.
- **Section 11:** Caller applications (e.g., sleep apps) should be aware of these distinct pathways.

## SECTION 04: Perceptual Constraints

### 4.1 Temporal Sensitivity: The 10:1 Asymmetry

#### Sekulovski et al. (2007) — Smoothness Thresholds

**Full Citation:**  
Sekulovski, D., Vogels, I.M., van Beurden, M. and Clout, R. (2007) 'Smoothness and flicker perception of temporal color transitions', *Proceedings of the 15th Color Imaging Conference*, pp. 112-117.

**Key Quotes:**

> "Results show a **significantly lower smoothness threshold for lightness changes than for chroma and hue changes**."  
> — Sekulovski et al. (2007), Abstract

> "the sensitivity to changes in lightness is higher than the sensitivity to changes in chroma and hue, when compared to spatial difference sensitivities."  
> — Sekulovski et al. (2007), Results

> "**No main effect of the base color point on the thresholds for lightness changes** was found for the chromatic color points... This shows **independence of the thresholds to changes in chromaticity and dependence on lightness**."  
> — Sekulovski et al. (2007), Results

> "A surprising effect can be observed in the behavior of the thresholds for the base color point 'Red'. While for Chroma changes, the thresholds for the condition 'Red' are not significantly different from the thresholds for conditions 'Magenta' and 'Blue', the **Hue changes for the same condition are significantly different**... This shows that possibly **different mechanisms are used in the processing of hue and chroma**."  
> — Sekulovski et al. (2007), Results

**Relevance to Paper:**
- **Section 04:** Justifies the 10:1 asymmetry weight ($w_L = 10 \times w_C$).
- **Section 05:** Lightness threshold is base-color INDEPENDENT; chroma/hue thresholds are base-color DEPENDENT.
- **Section 09:** Different neural mechanisms for hue vs chroma → potential for separate modulation tracks.

#### Kong (2021) — Temporal Color Vision Thesis

**Full Citation:**  
Kong, X. (2021) *Modeling the Temporal Behavior of Human Color Vision for Lighting Applications*. PhD Thesis. Eindhoven University of Technology.

**Key Quotes:**

> "Sekulovski et al. [121] found that the visibility threshold of smoothness, i.e., the maximum color difference between two successive colors that is allowed in order to perceive a temporal color transition as smooth, is about **ten times smaller for lightness changes than for chroma or hue changes in CIELAB**."  
> — Kong (2021), p. 3

> "This means that **CIELAB, which is a commonly used color space for spatial color perception, is not a useful space to predict the perception of dynamic colored light**."  
> — Kong (2021), p. 3

> "Today, **no color spaces are available that accurately predict the visibility of color differences over time**."  
> — Kong (2021), p. 3

**Relevance to Paper:**
- **Section 02:** Explicit statement that CIELAB is unsuitable for temporal transitions.
- **Section 04:** Justifies need for a "temporally uniform" space distinct from spatially uniform spaces.
- **Section 08:** Gap in existing literature that Color Journey could help address.

### 4.2 Chromatic Adaptation Dynamics

#### Gao et al. (2020) — von Kries Transform

**Full Citation:**  
Gao, C., Wang, Z., Xu, Y., Melgosa, M., Xiao, K., Brill, M.H. and Li, C. (2020) 'The von Kries chromatic adaptation transform and its generalization', *Chinese Optics Letters*, 18(3), 033301.

**Key Quotes:**

> "Based on his [von Kries'] hypothesis, chromatic adaptation in the visual system is considered the **independent gain regulation of the three types of cone photoreceptors**."  
> — Gao et al. (2020), p. 1

> "It can be shown that the modified von Kries transform also **satisfies the symmetry and transitivity**."  
> — Gao et al. (2020), p. 2

**Relevance to Paper:**
- **Section 04:** von Kries model assumes INDEPENDENT cone adaptation—basis for multi-channel processing.
- **Section 08:** Symmetry and transitivity properties are mathematically desirable for reversible journeys.

#### Süsstrunk (2005) — Sharp Sensors Thesis

**Full Citation:**  
Süsstrunk, S. (2005) *Computing Chromatic Adaptation*. PhD Thesis. University of East Anglia.

**Key Quotes:**

> "Most of today's chromatic adaptation transforms (CATs) are based on a modified form of the von Kries chromatic adaptation model... However, modern CATs apply the scaling not in cone space, but use '**sharper' sensors**, i.e. sensors that have a narrower shape than cones."  
> — Süsstrunk (2005), Abstract

> "We show that **these sensors are still not optimally sharp**. Using different computational approaches, we obtain sensors that are even more narrowband."  
> — Süsstrunk (2005), Abstract

**Relevance to Paper:**
- **Section 04:** "Sharpness" of sensor basis affects chromatic adaptation accuracy.
- **Technical Appendix:** Suggests room for improved CAT transforms in future work.

## SECTION 07: Loop Strategies

### 7.1 The Möbius Topology

#### Nölle et al. (2012) — Spinor Structure

**Mathematical Interpretation:**

- In Nölle's H2SI space, the hue circle has circumference $\approx 4\pi$ (not $2\pi$).
- This corresponds to **spin-1/2 quantum systems** where:
  - $360°$ rotation: $\psi \to -\psi$ (sign flip)
  - $720°$ rotation: $\psi \to \psi$ (identity)
- A Möbius strip requires 720° to return to starting point with original orientation.

**Relevance to Paper:**
- **Section 07:** Mathematical proof that the "twisted return" is NOT arbitrary but geometrically necessary.
- **Philosophy:** The Möbius metaphor is MORE than metaphor—it's topologically grounded.

### 7.2 Categorical Perception Along the Loop

#### Webster & Kay (2012) — Color Categories

**Full Citation:**  
Webster, M.A. and Kay, P. (2012) 'Color categories and color appearance', *Cognition*, 122(3), pp. 375-392. doi:10.1016/j.cognition.2011.11.008.

**Key Quotes:**

> "The physical spectra on which our color vision depends **vary continuously**, yet we categorize colors in terms of a **small set of discrete verbal labels**."  
> — Webster & Kay (2012), Introduction

**Relevance to Paper:**
- **Section 07:** Loop strategies can use categorical "landmarks" (Red, Blue, etc.) as waypoints.
- **Section 10:** API could expose categorical descriptors alongside continuous coordinates.

---

## SECTION 08: Gamut Management

### 8.1 Threshold Contour Orientation

#### Hong et al. (2024) — Radial Orientation

**Key Finding:**
The major axes of discrimination ellipses are **radially oriented toward the achromatic center**. This means:

- Discrimination is **poorer** along the saturation axis (toward/away from achromatic).
- Discrimination is **better** along the hue axis (tangential to saturation).

**Implication:**
- Gamut compression toward achromatic is perceptually "cheaper" than hue shifts.
- Saturation reduction is less noticeable than hue distortion.

**Relevance to Paper:**
- **Section 08:** Validates "compress toward achromatic" as perceptually optimal gamut mapping.
