# Handover Document: Research Librarian Forensic Audit

**Agent:** 📖 Research Librarian (Ellis)  
**Session Date:** 18–19 December 2025  
**Task:** Comprehensive evidence extraction from ALL collected PDF sources  
**Status:** ✅ Complete — ready for Research Consolidator synthesis

---

## 1. Mission Statement

The user requested a "forensic audit" of all collected research materials with explicit instructions:

> **"PhD rigor! and persistence. You will keep going over all these areas of the project until every question has an answer, every corner has evidence, and every insight is uncovered."**

The goal was not selective extraction but **exhaustive documentation** of every quotable finding relevant to the Color Journey Engine specification paper.

---

## 2. Guiding Principles

### 2.1 Academic Integrity Standards

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Never fabricate** | Every finding must have a traceable source |
| **Direct quotation** | Use exact quotes with quotation marks, page numbers where available |
| **Harvard citation** | Full author-date citations in Cite Them Right format |
| **Source verification** | Only cite from PDFs we have actually collected and read |

### 2.2 Extraction Methodology

1. **Inventory first** — List ALL available PDFs before extraction begins
2. **Systematic coverage** — Process each source methodically, don't cherry-pick
3. **Tool-assisted extraction** — Use `pdftotext` + `grep` for targeted searches
4. **Context preservation** — Include surrounding sentences for proper interpretation
5. **Section mapping** — Every finding must map to a specific paper section (§02–§12)
6. **BibTeX entries** — Create or update BibTeX for every new source cited
7. **Documentation of gaps** — Note explicitly when evidence is missing for a claim

### 2.3 Quality Thresholds

- **Quantitative findings** take priority (numbers, percentages, thresholds)
- **Novel claims** require exact quotation with source
- **Conflicting evidence** must be noted, not hidden
- **Gaps acknowledged** — If evidence is missing, say so explicitly

## 3. Source Inventory (What We Had)

| Source | Type | Key Contribution | Priority |
|--------|------|------------------|----------|
| **Fairchild (2013)** | Book | Hunt/Stevens effects, observer variability | HIGH |
| **Sekulovski et al. (2007)** | Paper | 10:1 temporal asymmetry (original finding) | CRITICAL |
| **Kong (2021)** | PhD Thesis | Temporal color perception, confirms 10:1, "no temporally uniform space" | CRITICAL |
| **Walmsley et al. (2015)** | Paper | 78.5% blue-yellow variance, circadian color | HIGH |
| **Hong et al. (2024)** | Paper | Riemannian manifold, geodesics, ellipse orientation | HIGH |
| **Nölle et al. (2012)** | Preprint | 720° topology proof, 4π circumference | CRITICAL |
| **Roberti & Peruzzi (2023)** | Paper | Schrödinger's color metrics, historical foundation | MEDIUM |
| **Gao et al. (2020)** | Paper | von Kries symmetry/transitivity properties | HIGH |
| **Süsstrunk (2005)** | PhD Thesis | Sharp sensors for chromatic adaptation | MEDIUM |
| **Spitschan (2017)** | Review | Melanopsin, 480nm peak, circadian pathway | HIGH |

**Total sources processed:** 10 PDFs

## 4. Practical Recommendations for Future Librarian Sessions

### 4.1 Document Search Protocol

1. **Implement timeout mechanisms** — Set maximum search iteration limits to prevent infinite loops when searching for documents online
2. **Define search boundaries** — Establish a predefined maximum number of search attempts before escalating to manual retrieval
3. **Use terminal-based downloads** — Employ `wget` or `curl` commands for file retrieval instead of agentic model searches
4. **Prioritize download control** — Terminal tools provide superior control over HTTP requests, retry logic, and file integrity verification
5. **Verify downloaded content** — Confirm file integrity and format before adding to source inventory

### 4.2 Search Efficiency Guidelines

6. **Pre-filter search targets** — Identify known academic databases (ResearchGate, arXiv, institutional repositories) before initiating searches
7. **Document search queries** — Log all search terms used, including failed searches, to prevent duplicate effort
8. **Cache successful searches** — Maintain a record of source locations for rapid re-access in future sessions
9. **Escalate blocked sources** — If a document cannot be located after three search attempts, flag for manual researcher intervention
10. **Verify source accessibility** — Confirm open-access status or institutional access before committing extraction time

## 5. Extraction Process Example

### 5.1 Terminal Commands Used

```bash
# Convert PDF to searchable text
pdftotext "source.pdf" - 2>/dev/null | grep -A 10 -B 3 "search_term"

# Multi-term search with context
pdftotext "source.pdf" - | grep -E "term1|term2|term3" -A 5 -B 3

# Page-specific extraction (when page numbers visible)
pdftotext "source.pdf" - | grep -n "key phrase"
```

### 5.2 Citation Format Applied

**In-text:**
> "The threshold for L* was found to be approximately 10 times smaller than for the chromaticity indices a* and b*" (Kong, 2021, p. 78).

**Reference list (Harvard):**
```
Kong, Y.W. (2021) Temporal Color Perception: Assessing the Visibility of 
Dynamic Color Changes. PhD thesis. Eindhoven University of Technology.
```

### 5.3 Section Mapping Format

| Finding | Source | Section | Relevance |
|---------|--------|---------|-----------|
| 10:1 L*/Chroma asymmetry | Kong (2021) | §04 | Quantitative basis for rate limiting |

## 6. Artifacts Produced

### 6.1 Primary Deliverable

**[COMPREHENSIVE_EVIDENCE_EXTRACTION.md](../research-artifacts/COMPREHENSIVE_EVIDENCE_EXTRACTION.md)**
- ~400 lines of exhaustive extraction
- Every quote properly attributed
- BibTeX entries ready for copy-paste
- Section-mapped summary table

### 6.2 Updated Artifacts

| Artifact | Updates Made |
|----------|--------------|
| [CITATION_MAP.md](../research-artifacts/CITATION_MAP.md) | Expanded from 5 to 10+ sources; added §05, §09 sections; complete bibliography table |
| [M1-chromatic-inversion-literature.md](../research-artifacts/M1-chromatic-inversion-literature.md) | Added Gao (2020) von Kries citation replacing placeholder |
| [M2-perceptual-loops-literature.md](../research-artifacts/M2-perceptual-loops-literature.md) | Added Section 12: Kong (2021) temporal findings |
| [M3-natural-cycles-literature.md](../research-artifacts/M3-natural-cycles-literature.md) | Added Section 3.2: Spitschan (2017) melanopsin pathway |

## 7. Critical Discoveries

### 7.1 Most Important Finding

**Kong (2021) PhD Thesis** — This entire dissertation is about temporal color perception. Key quote:

> "CIELAB... is not a useful space to predict the perception of dynamic colored light. Today, **no color spaces are available that accurately predict the visibility of color differences over time**."

**Implication:** This explicitly validates the paper's novel contribution. We are pioneering temporal uniformity for color journeys.

### 7.2 Quantitative Anchors

| Finding | Value | Validation |
|---------|-------|------------|
| Temporal L*/Chroma asymmetry | **10:1** | Confirmed by both Sekulovski (2007) AND Kong (2021) |
| Blue-yellow variance in twilight | **78.5%** | Walmsley (2015), vs 75.8% for irradiance |
| Hue circle circumference | **≈4π (12.65)** | Nölle (2012), mathematical proof |
| Melanopsin peak sensitivity | **480nm** | Spitschan (2017) |

### 7.3 Previously Missing Citations Now Found

| Concept | Was | Now |
|---------|-----|-----|
| von Kries symmetry/transitivity | "Citation Needed" | Gao et al. (2020) |
| Schrödinger line element | General reference | Roberti & Peruzzi (2023) with quotes |
| Temporal integration windows | Assumed | Kong (2021) with experimental data |

## 8. Lessons for Next Agent

### 8.1 What Worked Well

1. **Terminal extraction** — `pdftotext` + `grep` is faster than manual reading
2. **Parallel searches** — Search multiple terms at once with regex alternation
3. **Context flags** — `-A 10 -B 3` captures surrounding sentences for proper interpretation
4. **Systematic inventory** — Listing all sources first prevents missed materials

### 8.2 What to Watch For

1. **Page numbers are approximate** — PDFs don't always have visible page numbers
2. **Some PDFs are scanned** — OCR quality varies; may need manual verification
3. **Preprints vs. published** — Note publication status (some sources are ResearchGate preprints)
4. **Citation style consistency** — Always use Harvard (Cite Them Right) format

### 8.3 Gaps That Remain

| Gap | Status | Recommendation |
|-----|--------|----------------|
| Color harmony literature | Not yet covered | Task 012 addresses this |
| User study validation | No empirical data from our own studies | §1.6 Limitations should acknowledge |
| Implementation benchmarks | Theoretical only | Task 005 addresses performance table |
