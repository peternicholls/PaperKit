## Foundational References for Color Journey Engine

### MacAdam (1942)
- Full citation: MacAdam, D. L., 1942. Visual sensitivities to color differences in daylight. Journal of the Optical Society of America, 32(5), pp.247–274. https://doi.org/10.1364/JOSA.32.000247
- BibTeX key suggestion: macadam_visual_1942
- Relevance: Establishes empirical just-noticeable-difference (JND) thresholds and the anisotropic discrimination ellipses in CIE 1931 (x,y), which underpin perceptual uniformity assumptions and threshold-aware step sizing along color journeys. Provides the classic dataset for modeling local sensitivity and validating perceptual constraint heuristics.
- Recommended sections to cite: §2 (Perceptual Foundations), §4 (Perceptual Constraints), §8 (Gamut Management)
