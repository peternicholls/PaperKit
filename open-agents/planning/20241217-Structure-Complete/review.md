# Sprint Review: Structure Complete

**Sprint:** 20251217-Structure-Complete  
**Completed:** 2025-12-17  
**Agent:** Paper Architect (Morgan)

## What Was Accomplished

### Project Foundation Established
The Color Journey Engine specification paper now has a complete structural foundation:

1. **Canonical Planning Documents** — The three "constitution" documents in `0000-Project-Overview/` are fully populated with project vision, technical requirements, and content specifications.

2. **Detailed Paper Outline** — A comprehensive outline maps all 12 sections to research sources, establishes dependencies, and provides target word counts.

3. **LaTeX Skeleton** — All section and appendix files exist with detailed placeholders indicating what content goes where.

4. **Tracking Infrastructure** — Memory files track paper metadata and section status.

## Key Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| 12-section structure | Follows research consolidation recommendation; each section maps to one research document |
| ~10,000 word target | 8-12 pages typical for specification papers; matches research depth |
| 3 appendices | Separates reference material (presets, notation, examples) from main narrative |
| Harvard citations | Specified in project requirements; standard for technical papers |
| Pragmatic tone | Formal where needed, accessible otherwise—suits technical specification audience |

## What Changed from Initial Plan

- **Section count**: Expanded from generic 7 sections to specific 12 sections matching research structure
- **Appendices**: Added dedicated appendices for presets, notation, and examples (was single "supplementary")
- **Removed old files**: Cleaned up placeholder section files from template

## Open Items for Future Sprints

1. **Draft Phase 1** (§1–§2) — Introduction and Perceptual Foundations
2. **Draft Phase 2** (§3–§4) — Journey Construction and Constraints
3. **Visual assets** — Gamut boundary diagram, loop strategy examples needed
4. **Bibliography** — Formal BibTeX entries for OKLab, Bézier sources

## Reflection

The structure closely mirrors the research consolidation output, which should make drafting straightforward—each section has a clear source document. The five key themes provide consistent guidance across sections.

**Ready for:** Section Drafter to begin Phase 1 drafting.
