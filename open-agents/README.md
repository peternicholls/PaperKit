# Open Agent System (Starter)

This folder contains a starter **Open Agent System**. Agents are defined in markdown and direct an AI assistant to manage files and workflows without writing code.

## What's Here

- `INSTRUCTIONS.md` — System index, routing, and usage guidance
- `agents/` — Agent definitions (behavior, triggers, outputs)
- `tools/` — Optional helper scripts created by agents
- `source/` — Inputs or stubs you want agents to work from
- `output-drafts/`, `output-refined/`, `output-final/` — Output stages

## Quick Start

1. Read `INSTRUCTIONS.md` to see available agents and commands.
2. Use slash commands (or natural requests) to trigger agents.
3. Save inputs in `source/`, collect outputs in the `output-*` folders.

To add more agents, follow the templates in `INSTRUCTIONS.md` and `agents/`.
