# Paper goals and key research questions
goals:
  - "Specify a deterministic algorithm for generating perceptually-uniform color palettes"
  - "Define the journey metaphor as a constructive device for palette coherence"
  - "Document the complete API surface and caller responsibilities"
  - "Establish formal constraints (JND, gamut, smoothness) for quality assurance"
  - "Provide implementation guidance for reproducible palette generation"

research_questions:
  - "How can perceptual uniformity (OKLab) be leveraged for palette generation?"
  - "What constraints ensure visually distinguishable yet harmonious colors?"
  - "How should the engine handle gamut boundaries while preserving design intent?"
  - "What API design enables both simplicity (presets) and power (full parameters)?"

# Key themes (from research consolidation)
key_themes:
  - "Discrete Output, Continuous Thinking - internal curves, discrete swatches"
  - "Perceptual Uniformity as Foundation - OKLab grounds all decisions"
  - "The Journey Is Constructive, Not Prescriptive - coherence without prescription"
  - "Presets Encode Expertise - knowledge capture, not dumbing-down"
  - "Graceful Edge Case Handling - adapt rather than fail"
