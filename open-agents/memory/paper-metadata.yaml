# Paper framing (from tutor session 2024-12-17)
framing:
  purpose: "Internal team working reference for 'literally on the same page' alignment"
  not_for: "Generic specification for external implementation"
  focus: "Design rationale and 'why' over implementation 'how'"
  performance_context: "5.6M colors/second, microsecond-range, production-grade"

# Paper goals and key research questions
goals:
  - "Specify a deterministic algorithm for generating perceptually-uniform color palettes"
  - "Define the journey metaphor as a constructive device for palette coherence"
  - "Document the complete API surface and caller responsibilities"
  - "Establish formal constraints (JND, gamut, smoothness) for quality assurance"
  - "Provide design rationale for architectural decisions"
  - "Enable conversational section references during development"

research_questions:
  - "How can perceptual uniformity (OKLab) be leveraged for palette generation?"
  - "What constraints ensure visually distinguishable yet harmonious colors?"
  - "How should the engine handle gamut boundaries while preserving design intent?"
  - "What API design enables both simplicity (presets) and power (full parameters)?"

# Key themes (from research consolidation)
key_themes:
  - "Discrete Output, Continuous Thinking - internal curves, discrete swatches"
  - "Perceptual Uniformity as Foundation - OKLab grounds all decisions"
  - "The Journey Is Constructive, Not Prescriptive - coherence without prescription"
  - "Presets Encode Expertise - knowledge capture, not dumbing-down"
  - "Graceful Edge Case Handling - adapt rather than fail"

# Novelty positioning (from prior art synthesis)
novelty:
  claimed:
    - "Novel combination: continuous Bézier path + discrete sampling + perceptual constraints + mood expansion"
    - "Journey metaphor as construction device"
    - "Two-layer gamut management (prevention + correction)"
    - "Single-anchor mood expansion using lightness direction"
  not_claimed:
    - "First use of OKLab"
    - "First use of Bézier in color"
    - "First palette generator"
