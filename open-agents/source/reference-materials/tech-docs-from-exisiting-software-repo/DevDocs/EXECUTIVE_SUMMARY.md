# ColorJourney Project Analysis: Executive Summary

This summary captures the current state of the project, the design rationale, and where to find supporting evidence. For navigation and onboarding, see `README.md` and `00_START_HERE.md`.

## Current Snapshot
- Core engine: `Sources/CColorJourney/ColorJourney.c` (~867 LOC, C99, depends only on `-lm`).
- Swift surface: `Sources/ColorJourney/` (~885 LOC across configuration, mapper, journey class, SwiftUI extensions, umbrella doc).
- Tests: `Tests/ColorJourneyTests/ColorJourneyTests.swift` (52 XCTest cases) and `Tests/CColorJourneyTests/test_c_core.c` (C harness). Parity runners live in `Tests/Parity/`.
- Docs build: `make docs`, `make docs-swift`, `make docs-c`, `make docs-validate`, `make docs-publish` (see `guides/UNIFIED_DOCS_BUILD.md`).

## How the Palette Is Used
- **Continuous sampling** — `sample(at:)` for gradients, animations, and continuous data.
- **Discrete palettes** — `discrete(count:)` or `discrete(range:)` for indexed assignment (labels, tracks, categories). Use `%` to cycle when needed.
- SwiftUI helpers (`linearGradient(stops:)`, `gradient(stops:)`) return UI-ready output.

## Architecture in One View
- **Universal portability first:** The C99 core is the canonical implementation; language wrappers add ergonomics.
- **Separation of concerns:** C handles OKLab math, interpolation, contrast enforcement, deterministic variation. Swift surfaces configuration, presets, gradients, and platform integration.
- **Where to read more:** `UNIVERSAL_PORTABILITY.md`, `PRD.md`, `standards/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `API_ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAM.md`.

## Alignment with the PRD
- PRD dimensions (route/journey, dynamics, granularity, looping, variation) are implemented in the current API surface. Trace each requirement in `IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md` and `USAGE_AND_FULFILLMENT_ANALYSIS.md`.
- Known implementation differences (e.g., cube root precision, chroma modulation, hue discretization, contrast handling) between the C core and WASM are documented in `ALGORITHM_COMPARISON_ANALYSIS.md` and parity runner reports under `specs/003.5-c-algo-parity/`.

## What Exists Today
- **C library:** OKLab conversions, waypoint interpolation, discrete palette generation, contrast enforcement, deterministic variation.
- **Swift surface:** Type-safe configuration, presets, SwiftUI extensions, gradients, sequences/subscripts for discrete palettes.
- **Documentation:** PRD, architecture, quick reference, build/publish guides, release/playbook docs, parity and stress-test reports.

## Validation and Reliability
- Swift test suite exercises configuration presets, perceptual dynamics, looping, variation, discrete/continuous access, SwiftUI helpers, and performance harnesses.
- C harness (`Tests/CColorJourneyTests/test_c_core.c`) covers core behavior; parity runners validate against WASM outputs.
- Stress and portability investigations are under `stress-test/`; release gates and audit docs live in `RELEASE_*` and `ARTIFACT_*` files.

## Recommendations and Next Steps
- Keep the C core as the source of truth; record any divergence in parity reports.
- When adding features or wrappers, update `IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md` and tie rationale back to `PRD.md`.
- Close the identified C/WASM gaps before asserting output parity in new bindings.
- Consider convenience APIs (e.g., indexed sampling helper) and SwiftUI components to speed adoption; capture decisions in `UNIVERSAL_PORTABILITY.md` and `API_ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAM.md`.
