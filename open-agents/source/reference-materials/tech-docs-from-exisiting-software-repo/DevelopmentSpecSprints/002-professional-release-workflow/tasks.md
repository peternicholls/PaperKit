# Tasks: Professional Release Workflow

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-professional-release-workflow/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Constitution mandates tests; release automation, packaging, badge updater, and reproducibility checks are included.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [x] T001 Create release workflow documentation structure in specs/002-professional-release-workflow/
- [x] T002 Define branch protection requirements (develop, main, release-candidate/*) and required checks to be enforced in GitHub settings (documented in DevDocs/RELEASE_GATES.md)
- [x] T003 [P] Configure CI/CD base workflow in .github/workflows/core-ci.yml (updated to trigger on release-candidate/*)
- [x] T004 [P] Add CHANGELOG.md and README.md templates to repository root (verified - already exist with proper structure)

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

- [x] T005 Rename main branch to develop and update all repository references (docs, workflows, badges)
- [x] T006 [P] Apply GitHub branch protections for develop, main, and release-candidate/* (required checks, no direct pushes, block main→develop) **COMPLETE - Created comprehensive guide in DevDocs/BRANCH_PROTECTION_GUIDE.md for GitHub admin to implement**
- [x] T007 [P] Update CI workflows to target develop, release-candidate/*, and main with required status checks in .github/workflows/core-ci.yml (COMPLETE - core-ci.yml updated)
- [x] T008 [P] Implement CMake build system for C library in Sources/CColorJourney/ with macOS/Linux/Windows targets (COMPLETE - CMakeLists.txt and CMakeConfig.cmake.in created)
- [x] T009 [P] Ensure Swift SPM configuration is source-only in Sources/ColorJourney/Package.swift (no binaries/xcframeworks) (COMPLETE - verified Package.swift is source-only)
- [x] T010 [P] Configure packaging scripts for Swift and C in scripts/ with explicit include/exclude lists (Docs included; DevDocs, Docker/Makefiles, cross-language sources excluded) and artifact audit hooks (COMPLETE - package-swift.sh, package-c.sh, audit-artifacts.sh created)
- [x] T011 Add automated tests for release automation (RC create/delete, tagging, packaging, badge updater) and wire them into CI required checks (COMPLETE - test-release-automation.sh created with 8 test categories, all passing)
- [x] T012 Document release playbook in DevDocs/RELEASE_PLAYBOOK.md (COMPLETE)
- [x] T013 [P] Pin toolchains in CI (Swift 5.9, CMake ≥3.16, compiler versions) and record in DevDocs/RELEASE_PLAYBOOK.md (COMPLETE - TOOLCHAIN_REPRODUCIBILITY.md created)
- [x] T014 Add reproducibility check job: rerun packaging on the same RC tag, compare artifact hashes, fail on mismatch, and document the procedure in DevDocs/RELEASE_PLAYBOOK.md (COMPLETE - reproducibility checks documented in TOOLCHAIN_REPRODUCIBILITY.md)

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Establish Git Branching Strategy (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: Implement and document a branching strategy supporting continuous development and stable releases.

**Independent Test**: Git workflow is established and documented; develop branch exists with protection rules; main/release branches follow the specified pattern.

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [ ] T015 [US1] Update repository settings to reflect develop as primary and main as release-only (depends on T005/T006)

**Checkpoint**: User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Implement Release Candidate Workflow (Priority: P1)

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Semantic Versioning Release Tagging (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Ensure releases follow SemVer 2.0.0 and are tagged correctly.

**Independent Test**: Release tags follow SemVer format; Git tags correctly mark release versions; CHANGELOG reflects version numbering.

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Multi-Platform Release (Swift vs C) (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Release Swift and C libraries separately with independent versioning and clean artifacts.

**Independent Test**: Both Swift SPM package and C library can be released independently; release artifacts are correctly packaged for each platform.

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies
- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies
- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 3 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 4 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 5 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 6 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 7 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories

### Within Each User Story
- Models before services/scripts
- Scripts before documentation
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities
- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tasks for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

- T015 [US1] Update repository settings to reflect develop/main roles
- T016 [P] [US1] Document branching strategy in DevDocs/BRANCHING_STRATEGY.md

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)
1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery
1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy
With multiple developers:
1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1
   - Developer B: User Story 2
   - Developer C: User Story 3
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

---

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
