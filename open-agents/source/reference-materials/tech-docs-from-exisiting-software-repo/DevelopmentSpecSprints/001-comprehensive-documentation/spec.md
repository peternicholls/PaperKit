# Feature Specification: Comprehensive Code Documentation

**Feature Branch**: `001-comprehensive-documentation`  
**Created**: 2025-12-07  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Make sure the code is fully documented using modern best practices and standards"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Developers Can Understand the C Core Library (Priority: P1)

A new developer joining the team opens the C library headers and implementation for the first time. They should be able to understand:
- What each public function does
- What parameters it expects and what they mean
- What it returns
- What preconditions and postconditions apply
- Any gotchas or performance considerations

By reading the inline documentation and header comments, they can navigate the codebase, understand the design decisions, and integrate the library into their projects without needing to ask senior developers or dig through implementation details.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundation. Without clear documentation of the C core, all downstream layers (Swift, future wrappers) become harder to understand and maintain. The C core is the canonical implementation.

**Independent Test**: A developer can use the C library to generate a color palette with custom configuration, including multi-anchor journeys, perceptual biases, and variation, by reading only the header file and comments.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer with C knowledge reading `ColorJourney.h`, **When** they look for how to create a journey, **Then** they find clear documentation of `cj_journey_create()`, its parameters, return value, and expected lifecycle.

2. **Given** a developer reviewing the implementation, **When** they encounter complex algorithms like fast cube root or journey interpolation, **Then** they find block comments explaining the approach, why it was chosen, and any trade-offs.

3. **Given** a developer integrating the library, **When** they need to understand memory management, **Then** they find clear ownership semantics (who allocates, who frees, lifetime guarantees).

4. **Given** a developer concerned about precision or edge cases, **When** they look at conversion functions, **Then** they find documented error bounds, clamping behavior, and how edge cases are handled.

---

### User Story 2 - Swift Developers Can Navigate the Wrapper API (Priority: P1)

A Swift developer discovers the `ColorJourney.swift` wrapper. They should be able to:
- See what public types and functions are available
- Understand what each configuration option does perceptually (not mathematically)
- Know when to use `.discrete()` vs continuous sampling
- See usage examples inline or in docstrings
- Understand error handling and nil/default behavior

The Swift API should be self-documenting through DocC-style comments that render in Xcode's Quick Help, autocomplete hints, and generated documentation.

**Why this priority**: Swift is the primary user-facing API. Developers should not need external docs to use the library effectively.

**Independent Test**: A Swift developer can create a multi-anchor palette with custom temperature bias and discrete color generation without consulting external documentation, using only IDE autocomplete and Quick Help.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a Swift developer typing `ColorJourney(config:` in Xcode, **When** they open autocomplete, **Then** they see clear parameter names and inline documentation explaining each option.

2. **Given** the developer looking at `LoopMode` enum, **When** they hover over each case, **Then** they see in Quick Help what each mode does (e.g., "Seamlessly loops back to start").

3. **Given** the developer exploring perceptual biases, **When** they look at `ChromaBias` or `TemperatureBias`, **Then** they understand the perceptual effect without needing to know OKLab internals.

4. **Given** the developer calling `discrete(count:)`, **When** they read the docstring, **Then** they understand what contrast enforcement means and how it affects output.

---

### User Story 3 - Maintainers Can Understand Architectural Decisions (Priority: P1)

A maintainer reviews the code to make changes, optimize, or fix bugs. They should find:
- Why the C core is structured the way it is
- What the relationship between C core and Swift wrapper is
- Key design constraints (e.g., determinism, zero allocations for sampling)
- References to relevant documents (PRD, constitution, design brief)
- Links to external references (OKLab paper, performance analysis)

This enables confident modifications and helps prevent regressions.

**Why this priority**: Maintainability is essential for long-term project health. Future changes must respect the existing architecture.

**Independent Test**: A maintainer can read the codebase and produce a 2-page summary of why the system is structured as it is, citing specific code comments and linking to design documents.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a maintainer exploring the architecture, **When** they read the top-level comment in `ColorJourney.c`, **Then** they understand the overall design philosophy and key constraints.

2. **Given** the maintainer optimizing `cj_rgb_to_oklab()`, **When** they review the implementation, **Then** they understand why `fast_cbrt()` is used instead of `cbrtf()`, and the 1% error is acceptable.

3. **Given** the maintainer considering API changes, **When** they consult the codebase, **Then** they find references to the Constitution document establishing API stability guarantees.

4. **Given** the maintainer writing a new feature, **When** they review existing patterns, **Then** they find clear conventions for naming, structure, and testing that they can follow consistently.

### User Story 4 - Automated Documentation Tools Work Well (Priority: P1 - COMPLETED ✅)

The codebase should be formatted such that documentation generation tools (like Doxygen and DocC) can automatically extract meaningful documentation and serve them via a unified Docker interface. This enables:
- Generated API reference websites (Swift-DocC for Swift, Doxygen for C)
- IDE integration for quick help (Swift-DocC in Xcode, Doxygen browser)
- Unified documentation entrance at `/Docs/index.html` with Docker support
- Cross-platform documentation consistency

**Status**: ✅ Implemented and verified working
- Swift-DocC builds successfully via `swift package generate-documentation` with proper hosting-base-path configuration
- Doxygen builds successfully for C API documentation
- Docker containerization via `docker-compose.yml` serves all documentation at `http://localhost:8000`
- Unified index at `/Docs/index.html` links to both Swift-DocC and Doxygen
- Nginx configured for SPA routing with proper fallback handling
- `theme-settings.json` configured for Swift-DocC theming

**Why this priority**: Automation reduces manual maintenance burden, ensures consistency, and enables remote documentation access through Docker.

**Independent Test**: Running `docker-compose up` and accessing `http://localhost:8000/index.html` shows the unified documentation hub with working links to Swift-DocC at `/generated/swift-docc/documentation/colorjourney` and Doxygen at `/generated/doxygen/html/`.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a documentation generator reading the C headers, **When** it parses function signatures and comments, **Then** it extracts all public APIs with complete type information, parameter descriptions, and return values.

2. **Given** the Swift code and a Swift documentation tool, **When** it builds the docs, **Then** every public type and function appears with full documentation and examples.

3. **Given** generated documentation, **When** a user navigates it, **Then** they can find any public API and understand its purpose without ambiguity.

---

### User Story 5 - Examples and Tutorials Are Clear and Runnable (Priority: P2)

Example code in `Examples/` and in inline documentation should be:
- Self-contained and runnable without modification
- Annotated with comments explaining key steps
- Representative of real use cases
- Easy to find (referenced in main docs)

**Why this priority**: Examples are often the first thing developers try. Poor examples lead to frustration and misunderstanding.

**Independent Test**: A developer can copy any example from the documentation, run it, and see the expected output without any modifications or external setup.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the C example in `Examples/CExample.c`, **When** a developer compiles and runs it, **Then** it generates a color palette and prints or displays it correctly.

2. **Given** the Swift example in `Examples/SwiftExample.swift`, **When** a developer runs it in Xcode, **Then** it creates a journey and samples colors without errors.

3. **Given** inline code examples in docstrings, **When** they are copy-pasted into a test file, **Then** they compile and run correctly.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a developer reads outdated documentation that contradicts the code? (Mitigation: keep docs in code comments so they're updated with changes)
- How does the documentation handle platform-specific behavior (iOS vs. macOS vs. C)? (Approach: Platform-specific notes in relevant sections, consistent cross-platform semantics in design)
- What if terminology differs between C, Swift, and user documentation? (Mitigation: establish glossary, use consistent terms across all docs)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: All public C functions in `ColorJourney.h` MUST have block comments describing purpose, parameters, return values, and preconditions.

- **FR-002**: All public C struct fields MUST be documented with inline comments explaining their purpose, valid ranges, and usage.

- **FR-003**: All non-trivial algorithms (e.g., fast cube root, journey interpolation, contrast enforcement) MUST have explanatory block comments describing the approach, assumptions, and trade-offs.

- **FR-004**: All public Swift types (structs, enums, functions) MUST have DocC-style documentation comments (`///`) explaining their purpose and usage.

- **FR-005**: All Swift enum cases MUST document their perceptual or behavioral effect, not mathematical details.

- **FR-006**: All parameter names in both C and Swift APIs MUST be self-documenting and consistent with terminology used in the Constitution and PRD.

- **FR-007**: The codebase MUST include a top-level architecture document (in code comments or separate file) explaining the two-layer design, rationale, and key constraints.

- **FR-008**: All public APIs MUST include usage examples in docstrings or linked documentation.

- **FR-009**: All test code MUST include comments explaining what is being tested and why (test intent, not just assertions).

- **FR-010**: All references to external documents (Constitution, PRD, OKLab paper) MUST be included as comments or links in relevant code sections.

- **FR-011**: Complex behavioral guarantees (determinism, contrast enforcement, perceptual uniformity) MUST be explicitly documented where they're implemented.

- **FR-012**: The `README.md` MUST link to detailed documentation for developers (where to find code, how to contribute, common patterns).

- **FR-013**: A `DOCUMENTATION.md` file MUST exist, describing documentation standards, conventions, and how to maintain them.

- **FR-014**: All example code (in `Examples/` and inline) MUST be syntax-checked and verified to compile/run without modification.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

This feature primarily documents existing entities; no new data structures are required. However, the following entities are frequently referenced in documentation:

- **CJ_Config**: Journey configuration struct; documented as high-level design intent, not math parameters.
- **CJ_Journey**: Opaque journey handle; documented with clear lifecycle semantics (create, sample, destroy).
- **CJ_RGB / CJ_Lab / CJ_LCh**: Color representations; documented with valid ranges and conversion semantics.
- **Variation Layer**: Documented as optional, deterministic, with clear seeding behavior.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 100% of public C and Swift APIs have documentation comments (verified by code review and tooling).

- **SC-002**: Every public function has at least one usage example in its documentation or linked docs.

- **SC-003**: A new developer can understand and use the library after reading the header files, README, and inline docs, without external consultation (validated through onboarding feedback).

- **SC-004**: Documentation generation tools (Doxygen, Jazzy, or DocC) can parse the codebase and produce complete, ambiguous-free API reference.

- **SC-005**: All example code compiles and runs without modification (verified by CI/CD).

- **SC-006**: Code comments explain the "why," not just the "what"—maintainers can understand design decisions without external documentation.

- **SC-007**: Terminology is consistent across C, Swift, and user-facing documentation (verified by search/grep for inconsistencies).

- **SC-008**: Test code is comprehensible to new team members (comments explain test intent and expected behavior).

- **SC-009**: Documentation accurately reflects code behavior (no contradictions, verified through continuous checking in code review).

- **SC-010**: Developer onboarding time is reduced by at least 25% compared to the undocumented baseline (measured via time-to-first-contribution metrics).

### Assumptions

- The codebase structure (C core + Swift wrapper, located in `Sources/`) remains stable during this work.
- Modern documentation standards include DocC for Swift, Doxygen-compatible comments for C, and inline code comments explaining intent.
- The ColorJourney Constitution and existing PRD documents are the source of truth for design principles and should be referenced in code.
- Examples should cover the most common use cases (single-anchor journeys, multi-anchor, discrete and continuous sampling, perceptual biases).
- "Comprehensive" means all public APIs, key algorithms, and architectural decisions are documented; internal helper functions have brief comments.

---

## Out of Scope

This feature does NOT include:
- Creating entirely new documentation websites or wikis
- Rewriting existing user-facing README or guides (only minimal updates to ensure consistency)
- Implementing documentation generation tooling or CI/CD integration (documentation must be maintainable by hand)
- Translating documentation to other languages
- Writing marketing or conceptual content beyond API reference and architecture
