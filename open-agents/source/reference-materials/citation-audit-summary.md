**Full Citation:**  
Walmsley, L., Hanna, L., Mouland, J., Martial, F., West, A., Smedley, A.R., Bechtold, D.A., Webb, A.R., Lucas, R.J. and Brown, T.M. (2015) 'Colour as a signal for entraining the mammalian circadian clock', *PLOS Biology*, 13(4), e1002127. doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.1002127.

**Key Quotes with Context:**

> "Twilight is characterised by changes in both quantity ('irradiance') and quality ('colour') of light. Animals use the variation in irradiance to adjust their internal circadian clocks, aligning their behaviour and physiology with the solar cycle." (Walmsley et al., 2015, Abstract)

> "mammalian blue–yellow colour discrimination provides a more reliable method of tracking twilight progression than simply measuring irradiance" (Walmsley et al., 2015, Abstract)

> "we observed a progressive enrichment of short-wavelength light across negative solar angles: a result of the increasing amount of ozone absorption and consequent Chappuis band filtering of green–yellow light when the sun was below the horizon" (Walmsley et al., 2015, Results)

> "colour was in fact more predictive of sun position across twilight (-7 to 0° below horizon) than was irradiance (78.5 ± 0.1% versus 75.8 ± 0.1% of variance explained by solar angle)" (Walmsley et al., 2015, Results)

> "the use of colour as an indicator of time of day is an evolutionarily conserved strategy, perhaps even representing the original purpose of colour vision" (Walmsley et al., 2015, Discussion)

**Relevance to M3:** Direct support for natural chromatic cycles during twilight; blue-yellow axis as circadian signal.

## Section 7: Sekulovski et al. (2007) - Key Findings Integration

**Paper:** Sekulovski, D., Vogels, I.M., Beurden, M.V. and Clout, R. (2007)

**Title:** Smoothness and Flicker Perception of Temporal Color Transitions

**Citation Context:** Published in *15th Color and Imaging Conference (CIC15)* Proceedings, Albuquerque, NM, pp. 112-117

**DOI:** 10.2352/CIC.2007.15.1.art00021

**Obtained Via:** Kong, X. (2021) PhD Thesis - Modeling the Temporal Behavior of Human Color Vision. Eindhoven University of Technology. Referenced as [121] throughout thesis with extensive discussion in Sections 3.5 and 5.3.

**PRIMARY SOURCE:** Sekulovski et al. (2007) original PDF is available locally at:
`open-agents/source/reference-materials/color-perception/Smoothness and flicker perception of temporal color transitions - Sekulovski 2007.pdf` (306 KB, 26 pages)

**Critical Finding - 10:1 Asymmetry:**

> "The visibility threshold of smoothness, i.e., the maximum color difference between two successive colors that is allowed in order to perceive a temporal color transition as smooth, is about ten times smaller for lightness changes than for chroma or hue changes in CIELAB." (Kong 2021, p. 530)

**Design Implications for Color Journey Möbius Loop:**

1. **Luminance Critical:** Lightness transitions require much finer temporal resolution (smaller ΔE*ab step size)
2. **Chroma and Hue More Tolerant:** Can tolerate ~10× coarser step sizes
3. **CIELAB Not Recommended:** Despite spatial uniformity, fails for temporal transitions—reveals fundamental asymmetry
4. **Temporal Color Space Needed:** Ongoing research direction since 2007

**Additional Finding - Flicker-Smoothness Correlation:**

> "They measured the smoothness thresholds for linear temporal light transitions and the visibility thresholds of chromatic flicker at the same base color. They found a high correlation between both types of dynamic transition, suggesting that knowledge on flicker perception can be used to develop a model predicting the perception of smooth transitions" (Kong 2021, p. 1165)

This correlation suggests animations avoiding flicker will also appear smooth.

**Metric Innovation:**

Sekulovski et al. introduced **ΔE*ab/s** (Delta-E-ab per second) as the standard metric for describing temporal color transition speeds. This metric quantifies the perceptual rate of color change.

## Section 9: Fechner (1860) - Elements of Psychophysics

**Source:** Fechner, G.T. (1860) *Elemente der Psychophysik* [Elements of Psychophysics], Volume 2. Leipzig: Breitkopf und Härtel. English translation.

**File Location:** `mathematics/Elements of Psychophysics Vol 2 - Fechner 1860 (English).pdf` (1.7 MB, 431 pages)

**Status:** ✅ COLLECTED & ANALYZED

**Historical Significance:**
Gustav Theodor Fechner (1801-1887) established psychophysics as a quantitative science. This foundational work provided the mathematical framework upon which Helmholtz, Schrödinger (1920), MacAdam (1942), and Hong et al. (2024) all built their color metrics.

**The Fundamental Formula (Chapter XVI):**

$$d\gamma = K \frac{d\beta}{\beta}$$

Where:
- $d\gamma$ = infinitesimal increment of sensation
- $d\beta$ = infinitesimal increment of stimulus  
- $\beta$ = current stimulus value
- $K$ = constant

**The Measurement Formula (Chapter XVI):**

$$\gamma = k \log \frac{\beta}{b}$$

Where:
- $\gamma$ = sensation magnitude
- $\beta$ = stimulus value
- $b$ = threshold value
- $k$ = constant

**Fechner's Verbal Definition:**

> "The size of the sensation (γ) is in proportion not to the absolute size of the stimulus (β), but to the logarithm of the size of the stimulus when it is related to its threshold value (b), that is to say the unit size at which Sensation arises and disappears, or in short, it is proportional to the logarithm of the fundamental stimulus value." (Fechner, 1860, Vol. 2, Ch. XVI)

**Direct Relevance:**
- Foundation for JND accumulation framework (Hong et al. 2024 explicitly cites Fechner)
- Basis for logarithmic/power-law transforms in perceptually uniform color spaces
- Theoretical underpinning for Riemannian color metrics (Schrödinger 1920)

## Section 10: Hacker News Discussion - Oklab and Color Space Topology

**Source:** Hacker News discussion thread "An interactive review of the Oklab perceptual color space"  
**Date:** January 20, 2021  
**Thread ID:** 25830327  
**Status:** ✅ CATALOGUED & EXTRACTED

**PDF Location:** `pallet-generation/An interactive review of the Oklab perceptual color space Hacker News.pdf` (134 KB)

### Key Academic Concepts Identified

#### 1. "Super-importance of Hue"

**Formal Definition from Discussion:**
> "the ratio of perceptually distinct steps around a hue circle to those directly across through gray is greater than would be expected as a circle in an ordinary Euclidean space"

**Mathematical Implication:**
- Color space exhibits **non-constant curvature** (positive in some regions, negative in others)
- Impossibility of perfect perceptual uniformity in 3D Euclidean space
- "no more possible than flattening an orange peel"

**Relevance to M4:** Validates non-Euclidean color space topology and Möbius loop approach for managing circular hue.

#### 2. Geodesic Curves in Color Space

**Discussion Point (raphlinus):**
> "because of hue super-importance, a geodesic between two highly chromatic colors of different hues will bend toward gray, which might not be as representative of a 'gradient' intent as linear motion through a nice space such as Oklab or IPT."

**Design Implication:** Perceptually uniform spaces (Oklab, IPT) may produce more visually pleasing gradients than strict geodesics in non-Euclidean metric.

**Relevance to M1:** Supports careful choice of interpolation strategy for color journeys—not all geodesics are visually optimal.

### 11.1 Nölle, Suda & Boxleitner (2012) - H2SI Color Space

**Full Citation:**  
Nölle, M., Suda, M. and Boxleitner, W. (2012) 'H2SI – A new perceptual colour space', *ResearchGate* preprint. Available at: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259265578_H2SI_-_A_new_perceptual_colour_space (Accessed: 18 December 2025).

**PDF Location:** `pallet-generation/H2SI a new perceptual colour space.pdf` (7.9 MB)

**Status:** ✅ COLLECTED

**Key Innovation:**
Uses **4D normalized Hilbert space** from quantum mechanics to represent color perception, explicitly addressing "super-importance of hue."

**Critical Quote:**
> "'Super-importance of hue', as pointed out by Judd, requires a space for colour representations that enables unit circles to have a circumference of roughly 720°, i.e. twice the circumference of a unit circle in Euclidean space." (Nölle et al., 2012, p. 3)

**Mathematical Framework:**
- Resolves apparent contradiction between Judd's "no 3D Euclidean solution" and modern quantum information theory spaces
- Complex-valued spaces can encode hue super-importance geometrically

**Relevance to M4:**
- Alternative non-Euclidean color space formulation
- Validates impossibility of perfect uniformity in 3D Euclidean spaces
- Provides theoretical foundation for why circular hue topology requires special handling

## Section 17: Detailed Analysis of Priority Sources

### 17.1 Braun et al. (2017) - Visual Sensitivity During Eye Movements ✅ ANALYZED

**Full Citation:**  
Braun, D.I., Schütz, A.C. and Gegenfurtner, K.R. (2017) 'Visual sensitivity for luminance and chromatic stimuli during the execution of smooth pursuit and saccadic eye movements', *Vision Research*, 136, pp. 57-69. doi:10.1016/j.visres.2017.05.008.

**Key Findings - Quantitative:**

1. **Chromatic Sensitivity INCREASES During Smooth Pursuit:**
   > "Chromatic sensitivity was increased during smooth pursuit (about 12%)." (Braun et al., 2017, Abstract)
   
   > "actually increased by 15% (Schütz, Braun, & Gegenfurtner, 2009a)" (Braun et al., 2017, p. 58)

2. **Chromatic Sensitivity DECREASES During Saccades:**
   > "However, a significant reduction was also present for chromatic stimuli (about 58%)." (Braun et al., 2017, Abstract)

3. **Luminance Sensitivity Strongly Suppressed During Saccades:**
   > "During saccades, the reduction of contrast sensitivity was strongest for low-spatial frequency luminance stimuli (about 90%)." (Braun et al., 2017, Abstract)

**Direct Application to Color Journey:**

| Finding | Implication for Animated Color Transitions |
|---------|-------------------------------------------|
| **+12-15% chromatic during pursuit** | Smooth, continuous color transitions are **enhanced** during viewing |
| **-58% chromatic during saccades** | Avoid color changes during rapid eye movements |
| **-90% luminance during saccades** | Lightness transitions especially vulnerable |
| **Increased detection around pursuit onset** | Smooth acceleration important for color animations |

**Critical Quote for Velocity Research:**
> "For the time course of chromatic sensitivity, we found that detection rates increased slightly around pursuit onset. During saccades to static and moving targets, detection rates dropped briefly before the saccade and reached a minimum at saccade onset." (Braun et al., 2017, Abstract)

**Design Principle Derived:**
**Smooth pursuit enhancement validates gradual color transitions.** The 12-15% increase in chromatic sensitivity during smooth pursuit supports the use of smoothstep/ease-in-out velocity profiles that encourage pursuit rather than saccadic eye movements.

**Fills Gap:** 004 Domain 1 (Velocity Perception) - Confirms chromatic perception is enhanced during smooth viewing, suggesting color animations should optimize for pursuit rather than saccades.

### 17.2 Wang et al. (2022) - Psychometric Methodology for Thresholds ✅ ANALYZED

**Full Citation:**  
Wang, C., Zhang, S.-H., Zhang, Y., Zollmann, S. and Hu, S.-M. (2022) 'On rotation gains within and beyond perceptual limitations for seated VR', *IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics*, 28(5), pp. 2199-2209. doi:10.1109/TVCG.2022.3150489.

**Key Methodology - Two-Alternative Forced Choice (2AFC):**

**Experimental Design:**
> "we present an experiment with a two-alternative forced-choice (2AFC) design to compare the thresholds for seated and standing situations" (Wang et al., 2022, p. 1)

**Detection Threshold Framework:**
> "Results indicate that users are unable to discriminate rotation gains between 0.89 and 1.28, a smaller range compared to the standing condition." (Wang et al., 2022, Abstract)

**Psychometric Function Analysis:**
- Point of Subjective Equality (PSE): 50% detection threshold
- Just Noticeable Difference (JND): 25%-75% detection range
- Participants rate stimuli in paired comparisons
- Statistical analysis via psychometric curve fitting

**Application to Color Journey:**

| Wang et al. Approach | Color Loop Closure Adaptation |
|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| **2AFC design** | "Does loop return to origin?" vs "Does loop feel complete?" |
| **Rotation gain thresholds** | Chromatic inversion detection thresholds |
| **PSE = 1.0 (no gain)** | PSE = ΔE = 0 at loop point |
| **Detection range: 0.89-1.28** | Acceptable ΔE range at closure |
| **Beyond threshold tolerance** | "Twisted return" acceptability |

**Applicability Ratings Framework:**
> "we use a set of applicability items including naturalness, and sickness and asked participants to give their subjective ratings" (Wang et al., 2022, p. 2)

**Fills Gap:** 003 Domain 2 (Perceptual Loops & Closure) - Provides rigorous psychometric methodology for measuring loop closure thresholds and twisted return acceptability.

**Recommended Experimental Design for Future Work:**
1. **Experiment 1 (Detection):** 2AFC comparison - "same origin" vs "different origin" at varying ΔE
2. **Experiment 2 (Closure):** PSE for "loop feels complete"
3. **Experiment 3 (Twisted Return):** Applicability ratings for complementary vs identical return

## Section 19: Additional Source Assessment

### 19.1 Huang (2021) - Palette Generation for Image Quantization ❌ NOT APPLICABLE

**Full Citation:**  
Huang, S.-C. (2021) 'An efficient palette generation method for color image quantization', *Applied Sciences*, 11(3), 1043. doi:10.3390/app11031043.

**Paper Focus:**
- Image compression via palette reduction
- K-means clustering for color quantization
- Fast codebook search algorithms (Wu-Lin method)
- RGB color space optimization
- Reducing N colors to K representative colors

**Relevance Assessment to Color Journey Paper:**

| Aspect | Huang (2021) | Color Journey | Relevance |
|--------|--------------|---------------|-----------|
| **Goal** | Reduce colors (compression) | Expand perceptual space (journey) | ❌ Opposite direction |
| **Color Space** | RGB (device space) | OKLab (perceptual space) | ❌ Different domains |
| **Temporal Aspect** | Static images | Animated transitions | ❌ No temporal component |
| **Perceptual Basis** | Quantization error minimization | JND thresholds, smooth perception | ❌ Engineering vs perception |
| **Application** | Storage/transmission efficiency | Ambient lighting, UI animation | ❌ Different use cases |

**Key Difference:**
> "The key to color image quantization is a good color palette. If a good color palette is used, good reconstructed image quality of the compressed color image can be achieved." (Huang, 2021, Introduction)

Color Journey is **NOT** about palette reduction or image compression. It's about **perceptually-guided chromatic transitions** in time-based media.

**Decision: ❌ NOT RELEVANT TO RESEARCH AGENDA**

**Rationale:**
1. **Inverse problem:** Quantization reduces colors; Color Journey explores perceptual color space
2. **No perceptual grounding:** Focus on computational efficiency, not human perception
3. **Static domain:** No temporal dynamics or animation considerations
4. **Different color space:** RGB device space vs OKLab perceptual space
5. **No research gap filled:** Doesn't address any questions from 003 or 004 agendas

**Alternative Use:**
While not relevant to our core perceptual research, this paper's fast search algorithms (Wu-Lin method) could be tangentially useful for:
- Preset design (reducing journey to representative waypoints)
- Real-time palette selection from large journey
- **BUT:** This is implementation optimization, not perceptual foundation

**Recommendation:** Exclude from citation strategy. Focus remains on perceptually-grounded sources.
