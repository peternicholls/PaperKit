#### 1. Walmsley et al. (2015) - PLOS Biology (Open Access)

**Full Citation:**  
Walmsley, L., Hanna, L., Mouland, J., Martial, F., West, A., Smedley, A.R., Bechtold, D.A., Webb, A.R., Lucas, R.J. and Brown, T.M. (2015) 'Colour as a signal for entraining the mammalian circadian clock', *PLOS Biology*, 13(4), e1002127. doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.1002127.

**Key Quotes with Context:**

> "Twilight is characterised by changes in both quantity ('irradiance') and quality ('colour') of light. Animals use the variation in irradiance to adjust their internal circadian clocks, aligning their behaviour and physiology with the solar cycle." (Walmsley et al., 2015, Abstract)

> "mammalian blue–yellow colour discrimination provides a more reliable method of tracking twilight progression than simply measuring irradiance" (Walmsley et al., 2015, Abstract)

> "we observed a progressive enrichment of short-wavelength light across negative solar angles: a result of the increasing amount of ozone absorption and consequent Chappuis band filtering of green–yellow light when the sun was below the horizon" (Walmsley et al., 2015, Results)

> "colour was in fact more predictive of sun position across twilight (-7 to 0° below horizon) than was irradiance (78.5 ± 0.1% versus 75.8 ± 0.1% of variance explained by solar angle)" (Walmsley et al., 2015, Results)

> "the use of colour as an indicator of time of day is an evolutionarily conserved strategy, perhaps even representing the original purpose of colour vision" (Walmsley et al., 2015, Discussion)

**Relevance to M3:** Direct support for natural chromatic cycles during twilight; blue-yellow axis as circadian signal.

#### 2. Webster & Kay (2012) - PMC3412132 (Open Access)

**Full Citation:**  
Webster, M.A. and Kay, P. (2012) 'Color categories and color appearance', *Cognition*, 122(3), pp. 375-392. doi:10.1016/j.cognition.2011.11.008.

**Key Quotes with Context:**

> "We examined categorical effects in color appearance in two tasks, which in part differed in the extent to which color naming was explicitly required for the response." (Webster and Kay, 2012, Abstract)

> "The physical spectra on which our color vision depends vary continuously, yet we categorize colors in terms of a small set of discrete verbal labels." (Webster and Kay, 2012, Introduction)

> "In classical opponent color theory these boundaries are determined by the neural responses" (Webster and Kay, 2012, citing Hurvich and Jameson, 1957)

**Relevance to M4:** Support for categorical color perception and the continuous vs. discrete nature of color space.

**PubMed ID:** 27065363  
**Status:** Nature Neuroscience; full text requires subscription

**Key Finding (from abstract):** "memory-based expectations in human visual cortex are related to the hippocampal mechanism of pattern completion"

**Relevance to M2:** Supports neural basis for perceptual completion and memory-guided expectations.
