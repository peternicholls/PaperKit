## How to Start a Discussion

### Step 1: Choose a Category
Select the category that best fits your topic (see above).

### Step 2: Write a Clear Title
Be specific about your topic:

✅ Good: "How to cite multiple sources in a single sentence?"
✅ Good: "Idea: Add support for APA citation style"
❌ Vague: "Question about Paper Kit"

### Step 3: Write Your Message

**For questions:**
- Provide context about what you're trying to do
- Describe what you've already tried
- Include relevant errors or output if applicable

**For ideas:**
- Explain your use case or problem

## Best Practices

### Be Clear and Specific
- Use descriptive titles
- Provide context
- Include examples when helpful
- Mention relevant agents, commands, or workflows

### Search First
Before starting a new discussion, search to see if someone has asked the same question or proposed the same idea. You can:
- Add to an existing discussion
- Reference previous discussions
- Build on earlier conversations

### Be Respectful
- Treat all participants with respect
- Assume good intentions
- Provide constructive feedback
- Welcome diverse perspectives

### Stay On Topic
- Keep discussions focused on Paper Kit
- Use the right category for your topic
- If a discussion goes off-track, kindly redirect it

### Share Knowledge
- Help answer others' questions
- Share what you've learned
- Point to relevant documentation
- Celebrate others' contributions

## Common Discussion Types

### "How do I...?" Questions

```markdown
# How do I cite sources using the IEEE style?

I'm writing a paper on color mathematics and need to use IEEE citations instead of Harvard style. Is this supported? If not, what's the best approach?

I've tried:
- Looking in the reference_manager.md docs
- Checking the references.bib setup

What should I do?
```

### Feature Ideas

```markdown
# Idea: Add a Timeline Agent for deadline tracking

**Problem:** I'm juggling multiple paper deadlines and lose track of what I need to do when.

**Proposed Solution:** A Timeline Agent that could:
- Track section deadlines
- Suggest which sections to work on next based on timeline
- Alert when deadlines are approaching

**Use Case:** For longer papers (20k+ words), help writers manage complex timelines.

**Examples:** [link to external timeline tool]
```

### Show & Tell

```markdown
# Paper complete: "Mathematical Foundations of Color Perception"

I just finished a 12,000-word specification paper using Paper Kit! Here's what I did:

- Used /paper.init → /paper.objectives → /paper.spec for setup (took 1 hour)
- Sprints of 3 sections per week (4 weeks total)
- /paper.draft → /paper.refine → /paper.tutor-feedback cycle

The system really helped me stay organized. The modular LaTeX made collaboration with my advisor smooth.

## When NOT to Use Discussions
